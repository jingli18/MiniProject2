# MiniProject2
This project aims to use tensorflow to distinguish two classes of pictures.  
There are two main models, Keras and CNN based on AlexNet. Keras was trained to seperate cars and trucks. AlexNet was trained to learn the differences of cats and dogs.  
In model based on AlexNet, I constructed three models----two conv layers model and four conv layers model.
# Environment
###Python 3.6
###Tensorflow-gpu
#Training Guide
All datasets are in repository. Just run the car.py and train.py to train the model and see the result.
